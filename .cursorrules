this is a simple react and beat project that allows users to manage a JSON file on their computer without actually having to open an editor so it's going to give them a nice experience.

the file path is " ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"

styling is done with tailwindcss and daisyui whenever possible

never use "any" as a type

always add the type=button property to buttons

always use bun over npm for this project

JSX elements without children should be marked as self-closing
